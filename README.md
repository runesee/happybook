# What is HappyBook?
HappyBook is best described as IMDB for books. Users can search for and review a set of books, and save books they have read or want to read. Admins can add new books and remove existing ones. Data is stored in Firebase, and our backend is still operational. In other words, you can still run the application on your device and fully explore the website. 

You can read more about HappyBook on my [Portfolio page](https://runesee.github.io/projects/happybook.html).
